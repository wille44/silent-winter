         Everything around you is silent, no wind, no sounds of the forest, 
		 not even any cars passing on the nearby road. 
		 The silence is peaceful yet eerie and heavy, 
		 just like the snow now piling up on your chest as it falls all around you. 
		 You think how odd this road you where traveling 
		 along was. At first it seemed like any other 
		 highway aside from the fact that it was not on your G.P.S.
		 and had no sings indicating any speed highway number or any sort 
		 of civilization. The road only got more interesting as you progressed on your 
		 journey, this whole time you had never seen another vehicle on the road. 
		 The road looks as though it had been built and then abandoned, 
		 never even driven on, never maintained. 
		 You wondered why anyone would build a highway out here as the only 
		 thing you knew of for miles was your friendâ€™s cabin which he had recently 
		 inherited and invited you and a few other friends up for the weekend.
